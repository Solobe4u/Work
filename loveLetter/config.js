That is where we are. And in that space, I have found something rare. In the past 10months of knowing you - through laughter, silence, distance, even misunderstanding - I have come to appreciate you in a deeper way. I have seen your shy side, your thoughtful side and the version of you that only shows up when you feel safe.The fact that you are not shy around me? That means more than you probably realize. We have had our disagreements. We have had time apart. And yet somehow, we found our way back to talking again. That tells me something about us. I know your heart is still healing. I know you have been careful. And I respect that more than you know. I am not here to rush you,pressure you or compete with your past. I am here because what i feel is patient, intentional and real. So on this Valentine's Day - not to pressure you, not to overwhelm you but simply to appreciate what we have right now... <strong> Will you be my Valentine? </strong>💖</p>,`
